### What I Did

- Patent ([WO2020028431](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020028431) — Methods and Systems for Three-Dimensional Printing) for software methods on holography-based 3D printing
- Designed and implemented a real-time pipeline to process STL models: custom watertight voxelization, morphological operators, k-means clustering, and software-based optical correction for computational holography
- Constructed and partitioned 3D STL models into optimal chunks for voxel-based printing using two-photon absorption
- Implemented, benchmarked, and optimized GPU-accelerated computational holography pipeline using CUDA and OpenCV
- Implemented a watertight voxelization algorithm for very large and sparse 3D structures in C++
- Used OpenCV in C++ to process images with morphological operators, k-means clustering, and software-based optical correction
- Wrote a custom debugging tool to view and analyze large voxel structures with three.js
- Designed and implemented a Python micro-service to control, calibrate, and communicate between hardware (3-axis stages, SLM, liquid lens, industrial laser)
- Designed and implemented software for **HolographX** — winner of the Innovation Award at the Merck Technical Symposium
